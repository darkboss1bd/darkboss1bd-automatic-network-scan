#  Darkboss1bd Automated Network Scanner

Darkboss1bd Automated Network Scanner is a Python-based script designed for network exploration and security auditing. This automated scanner simplifies the process of scanning local networks, allowing users to identify active hosts, open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities. It integrates the power of NMAP, a renowned network scanning tool, into an interactive and user-friendly interface.

I will be adding more scanning options in the future.
